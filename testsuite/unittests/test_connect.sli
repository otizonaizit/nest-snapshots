   Name: testsuite::test_connects - sli script to test if Connect works as expected

   Synopsis: (test_connections) run

   Description:
   This test generates two neurons and connects them using different variants
   of the Connect command. To check if the commands work as expected, the
   resulting connectivity pattern is compared to the expected pattern.
